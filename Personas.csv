Jocko Willink Podcast
The MFCEO Podcast by Andy Frisella","I am trying to build something durable, I am trying to retire my parenets, what they are willing to admit and what they are doing under hood.

We acknowledge this person as much as humanly possible. They will tell you these things when you work with them. When they are under stress what they do say. We need to get 1m in less than a year as personal desire.
